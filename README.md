# Board-Game-Space-Race
This is an entirely fictitious board game similar to the popular ancient Indian board game, Snakes and Ladders. 

The game is a simple race contest based on sheer luck. It is played between 2 or more players (limited to 6 for this program) on a board consisting of 56 squares  and a pair of six-sided dice.  The object of  the  game  is  for  each  player  to  move  their  token  according  to  the  roll  of  the  dice  from  the  Start square to the Finish square, helped or hindered by landing on certain select squares. Players take turns rolling the pair of dice once and moving their token the required number of squares.  When all players have had a turn, that round is completed.The squares are numbered 0 to 55, with square 0 the “Start” square and square 55 the “Finish” square.  Each  square  from 1  to  54  is  either  an  “ordinary”,  “wormhole”,  or  “blackhole”  square.  Landing  on  a  “wormhole” or “blackhole” square will result in the player being transported to another square as part of their turn.  Landing on a “wormhole” square moves the player closer to the “Finish” square whilst landing on a “blackhole” square moves the player further away from the “Finish” square.

•Squares 2, 3, 5, 12, 16, 29, 40 and 45 are “wormhole” squares
•Squares 10, 26, 30, 35, 36, 49, 52, 53 are “blackhole” squares

Each player starts the game with a limited amount of fuel and landing on any square, at the end of their  turn,  results  in  the consumption  of  a  specified  amount  of  fuel.  Should  a  player  run out of  fuel  that player will take no further part in the game.  It is a possibility, though very unlikely, that all players may run out of fuel before reaching the Finish square in which case no one would win the game. 

Unlike most board games where the first player to reach the finish, wins and the game is over, in this game all players still in the game will complete their turn in that round. This gives the possibility that more  than  one  player  may  reach  the  “Finish”  square  in  a  round  and  so  there  would  be  multiple winners.
